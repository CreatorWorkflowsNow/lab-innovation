In this exercise, you will create a new **App** in **App Engine Studio**. The application can be thought of as a *container* to place all the artifacts created within this Lab.

1. To create a new **App** in **App Engine Studio**, click **Create app (1)**.

1. In the screen shown, you could add Roles to your App, which are used to assign permissions to users. For this Lab, we will just stay with the both Roles added for you by App Engine Studio. Click **Continue (3)**.
